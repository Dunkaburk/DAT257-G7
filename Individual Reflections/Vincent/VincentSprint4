Week: 17 (sprint 4)


Time spent: 8 hrs


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
Not much is new. We switched working partners, but I was left without a partner because my tasks were less important


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I worked really poorly this week due to other obligations (it was a very stressful week). Some of the team members had the same feelings, so we decided
to work a bit extra during the weekend. 
I got stuck for a long time trying to implement a splash screen correctly, there was apparently a new API released since our TA took the course. 
Had massive trouble with getting the logo to work correctly in android studio, it is still a bit weirdly cropped but the splash screen works (and
i understand how it works, which is most important to me)


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Not really anything big at all. Gonna keep at it next week.
