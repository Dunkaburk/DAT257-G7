Week: 20 (sprint 6)


Time spent: 12 hrs


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
Nothing new here really


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I completed both my tasks, merging some of my teammates branches and adding them into the navcontroller hierarchy, making sure that the user can navigate
through the app easily, adding a back-button etc. The splash screen works properly too.


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Was able to spend a little more time this week. Other than that nothing amazing.
