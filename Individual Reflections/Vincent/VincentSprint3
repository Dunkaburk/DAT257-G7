Week: 17 (sprint 3)


Time spent: 10 hrs


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to learn more about kotlin and android compose


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I finished both my tasks, creating a new logo and implementing NavController. I could maybe work harder next sprint, but I might be at optimal capacity.


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Nothing work/scrum-wise really, what has improved is my knowledge of kotlin and NavController.
