Week: 16 (sprint 2)


Time spent: 12h


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I feel like I want to learn more about Jetpack Compose, I am starting to get the hang of it but there has been 
some confusion on my part regarding how the Model-View-ViewModel works together in this language. Regarding Scrum,
I want to know wether I can cards on the board or if only the scrum master should do that (like when I finish a task)

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I finished my task for the week, and figured out a good task for next week, implementing the NavController. The team agreed 
that we would use that design (seems that it is standard in Jetpack Compose).

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have spent more time, completed more work and learned a lot more.
