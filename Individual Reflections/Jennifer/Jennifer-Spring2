Sprint: 2
Time spent: 8 Hours
What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
    - I am super exicted about yhe app development process and i find agile and scrum to be a very good tool that i would have liked to use in the earlier courses as well.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - I spent a few days with high fever and therefor missed a meeting and some work hours, but i worked with the step counting part of the app and it seems to go quite well! It's a bit
    difficult trying to understand all the sensors we need and how to get permissions, and since i don't have an andriod phone, i can only test the code in an emulator, but it's coming along
    nicely anyway!

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - I feel like we really have gotten into the team meetings, and even tough i missed one, the others kept me updated with the process so i won't be too lost when i come back.
    The team work feels great and even though i've had a hard time understanding sensors, i feel like i've learnt a lot about andriod app development already!
