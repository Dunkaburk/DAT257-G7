Sprint: 1
Time spent: 8 Hours
What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
    - Im very interested in the agile way of working, and look forward to learn more about it. Since we are making an app, i will also have to learn kotlin and andriod studio, which is exciting!

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - This week have been mostly set-up oriented, but i've worked with Alva och researching how to use API and permissions on how to import data from the phone's health app. I've also
    worked a bit with the trello board to make sure we know what we are supposed to do.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - Since this is the first sprint, nothing as of yet!
