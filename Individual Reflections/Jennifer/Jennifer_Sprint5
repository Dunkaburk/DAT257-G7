Sprint: 5
Time spent: 16 hours

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
    - I feel like i have gotten a very good understanding of our team work and the structure of the agile way of working, and i would like to adapt this knowledge
    to future courses and projects. I would like to get even more practise in using it! I would also like to be a bit better at coding

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - This week we decided to change our way of counting streps. We decided that since the automatic counter isn't working as intended, me and Jonathan decided to
    switch the plan and implement a way of manually entering steps. It's not what we intended from start, but it is working and gives us a working product.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - I feel like the communication this week has been better than ever, and i enjoy working with the team a lot!
