Sprint: 4
Time spent: 10 Hours
What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
    - I feel pretty comfortable with the agile way of working and our teamwork, however i still would like to get deeper knowledge about the code-aspect. I'm still struggling a lot with
    the code not showing the steps taken.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - This week got cut a little short due to a family crisis, so i missed a work (tillfälle?) and the review meeting. I tried starting a new project locally to see if i could rewrite the
    step counter and if the problem is somehow connected to something else in our project, but it still won't work. So this week as well, i feel like im not contributing a lot to the team.
    It is stressing me quite a bit, both because i feel like im not understanding why we have the problem, and i feel like everyone else is doing great work with their parts. Being able to
    count steps is kind of necessary if you are creating a health app that's supposed to count your steps.. So i feel like the project depends on me figuring this out. Even though everyone
    is trying to solve it, i feel like it's my fault it's not working.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - Switching partners worked great and it felt good trying that out as well!
