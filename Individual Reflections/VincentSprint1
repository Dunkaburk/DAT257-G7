Week: 
Vecka 15 (sprint 1)


Time spent: 
8 hours (only half week due to easter)


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?:
To me, the scrum, agile processes and teamwork seems pretty clear and I don't have any questions at the moment.
However, the IDE and language we are using was a lot different from what I expected (Android Studio and Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose). 
I haven't made an app before, only computer programs, and there is definitely more of a learning curve than I expected. I need to watch tutorials and 
read articles online to understand how things work.


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?:
My main complete contribution is a simple logo made in Adobe Illustrator, but this took only around 30 minutes to create. The rest of my time was spent setting 
up the IDE and learning the basics, which doesn't really contribute anything concrete to the project, but is highly necessary for my future contributions.


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?:
There was no reflection last week.
