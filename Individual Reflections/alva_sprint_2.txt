Week: 2


Time spent: 15h

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to get a deeper understanding about the technologies involved when creating a new app. I feel like I learn more and more each day and 
will hopefully get to use what I learned in future projects. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have been a part of all the teams meetings and contributed with my ideas and thought. I have been working with implementing the stepcounter 
and to get the correct value to appear on the dashboard as well as looked into other sensors we might want to use in our app. I have also researched 
about what API we want to use for distance and started with a list with cities and distance that we can use in the first versions of choosable goals. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This week felt better, I started this sprint with more understanding about the project, language and android studio and could therefore spend more
time working with the actual project rather than the setup. I also had more time this week which resulted in better results than the previous week.
