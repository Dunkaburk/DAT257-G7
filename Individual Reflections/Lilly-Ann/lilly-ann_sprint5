Week: 5
Time spent: 20 hrs

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I spent this sprint researching whether it would be possible for us to send notifications on Android, and came to the conclusion that we should. 
Next week I'd like to learn how to actually implement it. Getting more familiar with Git Command Line would probably also be beneficial as we keep 
running into problems with merges and such.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week I made a WaterPanel where one could view their water goals or change them to something else. I also researched whether sending notifications
in our app would be feasible with the time that we have left, and thought about what we should focus on with the last remaining sprint. I will bring it up
during our start-up meeting, so that we can make a game plan for how to get the most value out of our last week working.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

This week I worked alone on user stories that I was quite comfortable with, so I was able to get a lot done pretty quickly. I think I prefer working alone, since 
I can do it whenever it suits me and get really focused, but working in teams has also worked well.
