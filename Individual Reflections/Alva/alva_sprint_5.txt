Sprint: 5
Time spent: 20h 


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I feel like my understanding of working on a project with a lot of member has grown a lot. I would love to learn how
it can work in an even bigger project. I also would like to learn more about building and developing an app.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This sprint my main focus has been on UI updates on the dashboard on our app. I have also helped and informed the 
other team members about how the google maps API works and how to use it. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This week was exciting to see that the app is starting to come together. It was also interesting to switch 
programming partners and hear more about what the others had learn and done during the project.
