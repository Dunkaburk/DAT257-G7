Week: 2
Time spent: 8h
What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to learn and understand the scrum and agile processes more over time in the course. 
It has been a bit tricky to get started with it in the beginning but I hope to learn and understand more as the course and the sprints move foreward. 


What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I have been researching info about sensors and how to incorporate them in to our app. 
I have started to code but mostly doing research and getting everything set up. 
Next week I plan to help my team more by putting more hours than this week.
