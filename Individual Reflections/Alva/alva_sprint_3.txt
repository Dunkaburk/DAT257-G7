Week: 3 

Time spent: 15h

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
This week I feel like I've gotten a better understanding about the agile work flow. I think the team work has been working fine, and the next week we decided 
to switch the pairs that we program with I think that that will help with teamwork even more. 
this has given me an understanding on how the tasks work and also how to make the tasks a good size so that they can be finished in one sprint. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
As previous weeks I have been a part of all the teams meetings and contributed with my ideas and thought. I have also kept working with the stepsensor and 
implementation of a maps API to be able to calculate distance between cities. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This week has been better than previous week. I have been working with the same issue as before, but feel like this week has been closer to make the task 
finished. It got me thinking that we should make the tasks smaller to make it possible to finish them in one sprint.
