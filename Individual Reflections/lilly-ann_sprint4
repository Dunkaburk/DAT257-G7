Week: 4

Time spent: 20-21 hrs

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

I would like to understand Git better, because we have had a few problems with merge conflicts and branches not working as expected, which slowed a few of us down.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

Wanda and I made it possible to choose different types of goals from the StepPanel page, the finishing touches of connecting the pages can be done when the 
NavController is up and working properly. Being available for my team members and offering help when they ask goes a long way, so I will continue to do that 
in order to help my team do better next sprint.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?

We switched partners this week, and it worked great! New perspectives are always refreshing.
