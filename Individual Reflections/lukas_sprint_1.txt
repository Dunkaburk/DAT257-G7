Week: 1


Time spent:
14

What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
I want to efficiently work together, and to get a good start. I also want to get a good understanding
of kotlin and android development via compose, so that I can efficiently contribute to the project.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have created a basic project structure, and have started to implement the first screen. I have also
started to learn kotlin and compose.

in order to do better next week, i should be more communicative with the team, and i should ask for help
when i get stuck.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
