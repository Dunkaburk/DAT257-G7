Week: 
1

Time spent: 
10h


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?

My understanding of the Agile processes, especially the spring process has improved significantly but I quickly realized our sprint meeting at the beginning of the week underestimated the amount of work required to complete our tasks. Additionally, I realize working in teams greatly benefit projects where you are required to learn a lot of new information.


What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

This week we’ve mostly been doing setup things to make sure everything runs for everyone. This is in order to ensure everyone can work on their tasks properly. I personally worked on this setup a lot but we never really got everything working which led to my tasks not being completed. However, I still finished a “Top bar” for the app although I currently am unable to run it.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Nothing to report, since this is the first reflection
