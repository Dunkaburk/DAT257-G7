Week: 2


Time spent: 14 hours


What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
i want to become more familiar with kotlin and android studio. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
this week as a scrum master i have reached out to the team in the middle of the week for a minor check up on our
messenger. in order to help the team understand where they are at and what they need to do next. i have also been working on the bodyinfo of the app and trying to save the data.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have asked more reasonable questions to the team and have been more active in the group chat. aswell as led the group meatings more effieciently.
